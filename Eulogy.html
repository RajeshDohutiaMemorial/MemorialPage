                          A stable, good-looking, accomplished young boy. My early memories of him are those of being protected by him, of being carried home in his lap when I'd fall asleep in the car on the way back from late-night trips to Jatinga, of being teased no end. I'd get dressed for school, hair neatly tied in two ponytails, shoes polished, only to have my scrunchie pulled and hair messed up precisely when it was time to leave for school. He would play big brother to my friends and tease them equally. He'd be there, looking out for me, my sister, and ma and protecting us.
                          I would be amiss if I didn't acknowledge that the Dada I knew in the last 15 years was a troubled soul. I am trying to comfort myself by telling myself that he is at peace now, in a beautiful place...farewell, my brother, may your spirit be free. I hope you know that you are loved.

                            As a young boy as I remember my cousin, Raju da was a vigorous reader and a jovial person. I use to look up to him every time I saw him with all the interesting magazines in his study table or by the side of his bed. He was so up to date with sports events and current affairs. Raju da was a sports enthusiast and played tennis as a young boy. When he came to Tezpur to play Tennis we were so proud of him as growing up in Tezpur, playing Tennis was not in our scope. It was one of my Birthday when he came to Tezpur to play. He and his friends gifted me <a href="img/tintin.jpg" data-lightbox="true" ><mark><u>Adventure of TINTIN binder book</u></mark></a>. TINTIN books were expensive and it was a pride possession of mine as a child.
                            Last time when I visited home, I got this book for my kids to read. Little did I known that, this TINTIN book will be my souvenir of lifetime from Raju da with his handwriting on it. Will miss him a lot!!

                          As I always use to call him over phone or physically was a man loaded with good IQ and vibrant words. He was a kind person by heart and always use to think for the downtrodden people in our society. He was a commerce graduate with a management degree to his name. During his early days he worked for companies like Dabur, Eveready, ITA (Assam Branch), NETA etc at different positions. I knew him because he was my maternal Jethpaha's younger sister's (Bindu Pahi) son. Moreover, his In-laws residence is at a walkable distance from our home. Though I am quite busy in my schedule as a self employed person I use to take time out to meet him and converse with him regarding the positive aspects of our daily life. I always use to encourage him to get himself busy by doing some responsible work consistently. But I believe destiny had some other plan and as such he was diverted in another route which we humans have to surrender. At last but not the least O'Raju will be in my heart as a good friend of mine. May Almighty keep him in a corridor close to him and be like a twinkling star in the sky.
                          I pray to God for the eternal peace of the departed soul and a peaceful future for the entire family.

                          These above lines are truly said in the case of a man who is known to the world as Rajesh Dohutia (Raju). A tall, lean and thin man with a thick moustache having a heart of gold and always ready to help people in the best way he could. I have been knowing Raju for the last 18 years and never ever in my wildest dream, have I thought that you would leave us so early. Jovial by nature, free and frank.Sanjeev is a big fan of you."Gem of a person" is what Sanjeev said after meeting you. May the angels welcome you in a grand way in Heaven as you were welcomed on earth by your parents.I will surely miss you, but beautiful souls are never forgotten. Rest in peace my dear friend.

                              When I think of him now, all I can remember is how he would keep teasing me. And when I get mad he would say,'nijor bhonti hoi aru tuk bhal pau karone he tuk jukabo paru'.
                              He was someone who loves others deeply.
                              Though not related by blood but he had the right to tease me and I felt like I had the right to be mad at him for not living the life he could have.
                              For past few years I have been mad at him for not trying hard to have a better life. But the first thing that came into my mind when I heard that he is no more was that ‚Äúhow hard it probably was for him knowing that he could have had a much better life, seeing everyone around him trying their best for him and still not able to break the cycle.‚Äù
                              That day I was able to acknowledge that in reality he was a victim, suffering the consequences of....life
                              I guess death, the end, has a way of changing your perspective. You realize that there is no last phone call, that person is gone forever, whatever you said or didn‚Äôt say, whatever they did or didn‚Äôt do doesn‚Äôt matter anymore. And the cloud of biases gets cleared and you can see life for what it is!
                              Raju da, I think that was your last lesson to me üôèüèº May you find peace. <br><p align="right"> - Ankita Saikia (Tinky) </p>

                            Ever since I have known Raju or whenever someone talked about Raju, the image that came to my mind was that of his sparkling eyes and trademark smiles!!.
                            He was a continuous source of amusement and mischievousness ever since he was a little boy! So many images coming to my mind when we laughed until we couldn‚Äôt take it any more üòÇüòÇ People you had never met, he would paint a mental picture in such a way with their little idiosyncrasies and personality traits that you would want to meet them after you heard those little stories.Those instant jokes were nothing but a mark of his high intelligence!
                            His knowledge of sports of all kinds particularly tennis that he played at the state level, music specifically western, politics around the world had no bounds. When we were little and there were minimal sources of external knowledge he had this immense information from whatever possible sources he could acquire from. Raju had a naturally inquisitive nature that only grew with his age.
                            I don‚Äôt remember Raju winning any physical trophy üèÜ but he won hearts of hundreds of people and it is in those hearts that he will live forever! His respect for another human irrespective of economic class ,color, and race was exemplary. We used to tease him about his kindness - ‚Äútoi nijor nathakileo bhikkharik ubhoti goi paas toka di ahibi‚Äù ( Even if you don‚Äôt have any money, you won‚Äôt miss a chance to give alms to a beggar).
                            ‚ÄúOi Luku oi luku ...biddya xopot‚Äù ... Neil Young, Carpenters songs from his Black music systems .. those laughters .... are constantly ringing on my ears. Those sparkling eyes and smiles will always be on my heart though he left us too soon. So long dear cousin and God speed!‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®

                            It is really tough for me to believe that he shall never pass by me again when I am  near our Housing Society's gate.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is tough for me to make myself realise that he will never call me again to enquire about any Cricket Match Score or Any Society related matter and eventually end up telling me that "I know you are doing good work but Ma wants to tell you something But I have already explained her, you dont worry.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is definely tough for me that when I am into some confusion regarding any General Knowledge topic that I cannot ask the Knowledgable Raju Da.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is even tougher for me to make myself believe that he shall not emerge from some corner of our Complex dancing and Hugging me during Festivals and crack some Jorhotia or His college days jokes.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It will be tough for me to free my mind of his presence in my life as an elder Brother, friend and ofcourse a Knowledgable Well Wisher.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            So Raju Da,  without doing the above TOUGH tasks I shall ever keep you in my memories and cherish your love and wishes all my life. And also like to remember your words you used to tell me:

                            ‚ÄòOy kukur, phone eta kor‚Äô ‚Äì was a very normal language in the text-messages that would come over the FB messenger or on the WhatsApp every few months from Raju. Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt (conveniently blamed it to the hectic work-travels or other life‚Äôs priorities) make an immediate call back ‚Äì just replied with a text message or just ignored. Sometime, when the stars and the moon were aligned, I actually called him and we had a nice catch up session. Whether I called or not, replied or not, spoke to him at length or just a quickie, one person who never frowned and always said ‚ÄòI love you to the core bondhu‚Äô was Raju. His genuineness, heartfulness and seriousness to the relationships and friendships were parallel to none. He‚Äôs gone too soon!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I think was sometime in 1993, a good looking (may be the right words would be ‚Äòa dashing young man‚Äô with an enviable height and the ‚Äòmanly‚Äô 90‚Äôs thick tache) chap came to Dipam‚Äôs room at the Gauhati Commerce College Hostel and I was introduced as Dipam‚Äôs friend who used to play tennis in the past years and had hailed from Jorhat originally. That one introduction and the migration from ‚Äòtumi‚Äô to ‚Äòtoi‚Äô was almost immediate. Says it all, doesn‚Äôt it?
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            25-26 years on, today I am heartbroken to get this opportunity to write this note ‚Äì which I am clearly struggling to find words for. We will live with those awesome memories of Delhi years (we were more than just housemates), those end-less talks, those evening sessions, and most importantly, our first step in the job world/ rate-race. Were we always thick and remained close? Well, may be not! Evidently ‚Äòlife‚Äô happened to all of us! During last 15-20 years, we all got sucked into the strings of usual events ‚Äì new family, job, parenthood, career aspiration, relocation, priorities, complexities etc. Did anything change in the friendship? Absolutely not, except that the communication frequencies took a major hit in our 30‚Äôs (actually, got better in the recent years). And which is why, my friend, I cannot help but feel a bit guilty today of not steering your path in those years as a true friend of yours. Know it is too late a realisation now! Despite being such a good friend, I think, I never understood what he wanted from life. I wouldn‚Äôt lie ‚Äì I did try to dig a few times too and explore if he had any regret from his life for which he adopted a free-spirited lifestyle ‚Äì but to avail none. Guess he is as clueless! As a friend, I certainly could do better.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Two things, neither I nor Raju was clueless about him. One, his substance and genuineness in friendship. This is not the only example - a few months ago, when my father was hospitalised in a Guwahati hospital, he made a call to my mother and sisters quite regularly and asked what he could do to help. While people were sceptical (naturally) coming to the hospital due to the covid-19 situation, he was always ready to offer his service in person. When my father passed away with a small stint of illness in June, he had comforted my mother with his warm and heartfelt words. Second and the most important character defining point about Raju was his intense love and care for his own family. It was just a few weeks back, he and I were exchanging texts about covid situation in Guwahati (direct quotes below):
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            - ME: Take care Raju. This virus not essentially kill everyone that comes to contact of it, but good to avoid, especially for Khura khuri. Tekhet xokolok ghoror pora olabi nidibi.
                            <br>
                            - RAJU: Moi tu ghuri phuru, moi moriboloi bhoi nai, Prithibir aru porialor buja eta... Bhoi lagey Taa, Ma, Umpi, Putuka & all the family members...Moi Jodi carry koru? What will happen to them?
                            <br>
                            - ME: Stop ghuri phura then. Irony is you know the problems, but don‚Äôt do anything remedial. Kihor karone ghuri phuro?
                            <br>
                            - RAJU: Bohut bhal Pau tuk (Here I could ‚Äòsee‚Äô his smirk and an attempt to avoid a situation to get a round of gali from me).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Nothing he loved more than his family. Perhaps every few weeks, he would post a few pictures (many a times, repeat posts) of his family on Facebook and openly shared how proud and loving he was. What a gem of guy!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            May be you were too good, bondhu, so God just put his arms around you and taken you in under his own wing. You always liked a bit of special treatment, didn‚Äôt you? Have a good ride in this new journey and I will join you again when my time comes for the next chapter. Till then you will not be forgotten.

                            <br>
                            Geordie and I had a lot of fun meeting you in 1999 at your sister‚Äôs and Jason‚Äôs wedding. Everything was exciting and exotic to our Canadian eyes. You were a lot of fun. I remember how handsome and welcoming you were. Geordie went with you on your motorcycle to the airport. That looked like a better way to get there.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            At Bipi‚Äôs wedding, we got to know Putuka and Umpi. I know you loved your family intensely. They will carry on because they are strong women. They will have important life skills.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            No one knows the challenges you faced, and I trust you will find peace and understanding. I hope all who have supported your mother and father these past days will learn of the richness and beauty of the love your family shares. Blessings as we grieve an unfinished life, and the courage handed to all of us remaining.
